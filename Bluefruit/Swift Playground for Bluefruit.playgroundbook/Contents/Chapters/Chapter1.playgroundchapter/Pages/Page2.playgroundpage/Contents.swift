 **Goal**: Learn how to use movement commands with specific durations.
 
 By default, each command sent to Robot Rover will last for a predetermined duration, but you can issue commands with specific durations by including a numeric value in milliseconds.
 
 **Example:** the command `moveForward(1000)` will make Robot Rover move forward for one second. The command `wait(300)` will cause the robot to pause for three hundred milliseconds.
 
 **Instructions:** Enter 3 or more commands with durations and then press the **Run My Code** button.
